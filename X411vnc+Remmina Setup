Perfect 👌 that’s the ideal starting point — 2 Linux Mint PCs on the same LAN.
Let’s go step by step from scratch so you can test everything cleanly:

🧩 GOAL:

You’ll be able to see & control PC-B (the “client”) from PC-A (the “controller”) — all over LAN, no internet, no lag.

🖥️ Step 1 — On Both PCs

Make sure both are connected to the same LAN (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
Check IPs:

ip a | grep inet


You should see both in the same range, e.g.:

PC-A → 172.16.5.10

PC-B → 172.16.5.22

If they’re like 172.16.x.x both, you’re good.

⚙️ Step 2 — On the CLIENT (the one you’ll control)

Let’s set it up so it broadcasts its screen over LAN.

1️⃣ Set a hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname pc-b

2️⃣ Install tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x11vnc avahi-daemon -y

3️⃣ Start Avahi (for .local names)
sudo systemctl enable --now avahi-daemon

4️⃣ Set VNC password
x11vnc -storepasswd

5️⃣ Start x11vnc (screen sharing)
x11vnc -forever -usepw -shared -auth guess -display :0


Leave that terminal open (for now).
It’s now sharing its desktop on port 5900.

💻 Step 3 — On the CONTROLLER (your main PC)
1️⃣ Install Remmina (the viewer)
sudo apt install remmina -y

2️⃣ Open Remmina → Click “+” to add new connection

Protocol: VNC

Server: pc-b.local:5900

Username/password: leave blank or use the VNC password you set

Then connect ✅
You should see PC-B’s desktop instantly.
No lag, no cloud, 100% LAN.

🧠 Step 4 (Optional — Auto-start at boot)

If you want PC-B to always share its screen automatically:

sudo nano ~/.bashrc


Add at the bottom:

x11vnc -forever -usepw -shared -auth guess -display :0 &


Now it’ll auto-start when that user logs in.

🚀 Step 5 — Test Hostname Discovery

From PC-A:

ping pc-b.local


If it replies — everything is perfect.
If not, check that avahi-daemon is running on both:

sudo systemctl status avahi-daemon


✅ That’s it — now you’ve got:

No latency

Free & open-source setup

Works offline/LAN

Uses .local names instead of IPs

Scales easily to 200 PCs later
